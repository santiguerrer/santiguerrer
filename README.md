#Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of personal and academic projects that showcase my skills, interests, and growth as a cybersecurity graduate. These projects were created to build experience, explore new technologies, and prepare for jobs in the tech industry.


## About Me

Hi, I'm Santiago Guerrero, a Bachelor's graduate in Cybersecurity. I hold the CompTIA Security+ certification and am looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge to real-world environments.

## üîê Featured Projects

### üß† [Brute Force SSH Lab](https://github.com/santiguerrer/brute-force-lab)
Simulated a brute-force attack using Hydra, Crunch, and Nmap in a safe lab environment. Explored password strength weaknesses and analyzed system logs to detect intrusion attempts.

### üïµÔ∏è [OWASP Top 10 ‚Äì Cryptographic Failures](https://github.com/santiguerrer/owasp-crypto-failures-lab)
Investigated a vulnerable web application that exposed sensitive user data through weak encryption and improper API handling. Demonstrated how poor object structure and weak protections expose PII.

### üß™ [Penetration Test ‚Äì ACME Bookkeeping](https://github.com/santiguerrer/acme-penetration-test)
Led a full-scale simulated penetration test targeting network infrastructure, web applications, and internal systems. Documented findings include SQL injection, outdated systems, weak access control, and open ports.

### üïµÔ∏è [CyberDefenders WebStrike Lab](https://github.com/santiguerrer/webstrike-lab)
Conducted a network forensic investigation to trace an attacker's activities, including identifying the source IP, analyzing the User-Agent, detecting a malicious web shell, and uncovering data exfiltration attempts.

### üîç [BTLO ‚Äì Deep Blue Lab](https://github.com/santiguerrer/btlo-deepblue)
Investigated Windows event logs using DeepBlueCLI to uncover RDP brute-force, malicious service creation, privilege escalation, and user account manipulation.
